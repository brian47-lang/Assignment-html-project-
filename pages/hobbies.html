         <h3>My hobbies</h3>
         <p>
            I am someone who loves to engage in various activities such as cooking, playing football, travelling, and playing video games.<br>
            My passion for football is evident from the fact that I was the top scorer for interclass competitions in my high school in 2014.<br>
            Additionally, I have volunteered as a cook in a dairy and snacks shop, where I honed my culinary skills.<br>
             Moreover, I am also passionate about giving back to the community, and as a result, I volunteered as a football coach for under 10 and under 12-year-olds at Windhoek International school in Namibia from January 2020 to December 2020.<br>
              Overall, I am a well-rounded individual with a diverse set of skills and interests, always looking for ways to learn and grow.
